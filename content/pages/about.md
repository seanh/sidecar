Title: About
Summary:
    <b>Sidecar</b> is a plain but pretty theme for the
    [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) static site generator that works great on
    both mobile and desktop.

This <i>About</i> page is an example of what a static page looks like with
Sidecar.
For documentation, see [Sidecar's README on GitHub](https://github.com/seanh/sidecar).

Sidecar's page layout is inspired by the [Klisé theme for Jekyll](https://klise.vercel.app/).
