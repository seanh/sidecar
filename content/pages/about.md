Title: About
Summary:
    This is the demo site for <b>Sidecar</b>, a plain but
    pretty theme for the Pelican static site generator.
    See the <a href="https://github.com/seanh/sidecar">README</a>
    for docs.

Sidecar is based on **Oatcake**, my universal CSS typography theme.
See [Oatcake's site](https://www.seanh.cc/oatcake/) for documentation:
anything you see on that page, you can use in your pages and articles with Sidecar.
The dummy articles on this demo site show [some of the elements in action]({filename}/sunt_excepturi_eius_nihil_ea_dignissimos_dolores.md).

Sidecar's page layout is inspired by the [Klisé theme for Jekyll](https://klise.vercel.app/).
